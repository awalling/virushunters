This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Load in your 20 viral scaffolds data set (you may need to get this file from Emily, Nada, or Amanda if you don't have it already.)
#twenty_viral_scaffolds <- 

#twenty_viral_scaffolds
```

```{r}
#In order to write a function to calculate a 95% confidence interval for the mean of the 20 scaffolds data set, you will need to use a function called qt(), which outputs the t-value for a given confidence level and sample size.

#For example, if I want the two-tailed t-value for a confidence level of 95% and a sample size of 50, I would write:

qt(p=0.975, df = 49)

#We use p = 0.975, and not p = 0.95, because this is a two-tailed test: 1 - 0.975 is 0.025, and so the margin of error contains the mean +/- t at 0.025, or a total error of 0.05.
```

```{r}
#Write a function to output a confidence interval, based on the formula we discussed today, and using the function qt() to generate the t-value at a given confidence level.

conf_int <- 


  
#Calculate the 95% confidence interval for the twenty scaffolds data set.

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
