This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
#Your challenge today is to write a simple function to transcribe a DNA sequence into an RNA sequence.

#In all cells, DNA needs to be transcribed to RNA, the "messenger" molecule which allows cells to take information encoded in our genes and make proteins from that information.

#RNA is very similar to DNA, with one difference: instead of having Thymine, or "T", RNA has Uracil, or "U".

#In our cells, RNA Polymerase makes copies of DNA that transcribes "G" into "C", "C" into "G", "T" into "A", and "A" into "U".

#This will be our first experience working with strings in R - we will need to learn some new base functions in order to accomplish this task.

#Below is a short DNA sequence to test your function on:

DNAstring <- "ATGCATATGCATC"
```

```{r}
#One useful function in R that can be used for pattern matching and replacement is gsub.

#gsub is very similar to grep, the regular expression function we learned for use in Terminal back in the fall.  

#To learn more about gsub, run this block of code to read its documentation:

?gsub

```

```{r}
#Here is a quick example of how to use gsub:

gsub("A", "U", DNAstring)

#As you can see, all of the "A" letters in the string have been changed to "U".
```

```{r}
#Can you write a function that will transcribe a string of DNA sequence?
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
